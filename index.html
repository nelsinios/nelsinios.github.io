           <p><font = "arial">I'm on enthusiastic and positive individual that strives to do right by other people and also expect the some in return. I enjoy some sports, my hobbies range from ploying golf to spending a good hour (or 12) ploying Ploystotion. I've spent the pandemic learning to broaden my culinary sl<iills, developing my digital skills and learn new things. 
<br>I was born in Melbourne with my background stemming to my paternal grandparents migrating from Europe during the Second World War and my maternal Grandparents were third generation Australians who descended from migrants from England. 
<br>One of my favourite places on this planet ore the tropical getaways found in Thailand and Bali followed by the place I grew up that I will always coll home - the Gold Coast. I om also currently halfway through a Dachelor of Dusiness that is undertaken through Griffith University in Queensland.
