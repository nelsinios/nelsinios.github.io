           <p><font="arial">I'm on enthusiastic and positive individual that strives to do right by other people and also expect the some in return. I enjoy some sports, my hobbies range from ploying golf to spending a good hour (or 12) ploying Ploystotion. I've spent the pandemic learning to broaden my culinary sl<iills, developing my digital skills and learn new things. 
<br>I was born in Melbourne with my background stemming to my paternal grandparents migrating from Europe during the Second World War and my maternal Grandparents were third generation Australians who descended from migrants from England. 
<br>One of my favourite places on this planet ore the tropical getaways found in Thailand and Bali followed by the place I grew up that I will always coll home - the Gold Coast. I om also currently halfway through a Dachelor of Dusiness that is undertaken through Griffith University in Queensland.

<br>My interest in IT began from the young age of eight or nine years of age, where I tool<i computer classes as on elective and learned the basics, such as Microsoft Office and also participated in the Lego robotics worl<ishops that were held ofter school some weeks. As years went by and I entered my teenage years I was interested in the world of madding computer games, such as madding new units in Age of Empire II and Star Wars Galactic Dattlegrounds, rwo real time strategy games I spent countless hours on playing and mal<iing my own cam­paigns and mops. The inner worl<iings of the game really intrigued to modifying content to match up things I envision and helped a few Pokemon fan-game projects during high school with graphics and design elements for a team building experience. 
I remember picl<iing up my first video game, called Wonder Doy on the Sego Moster System when I was around three years old and exclaiming to my parents ·sunshine in the trees!" whenever my character died, it was amusing at the time and essentially inducted me to enjoy gaming as a hobby as I got a little bit older. I remember when we got our very first video game console, the Super Nintendo Yoshi's Island console bundle for Christmas in 1995 and I l<inew it was going to change my life forever. I remember gathering around with my mum, dad and younger sister and tol<iing rurns ploying the first level and being defeated by Shy Guys and the Pirohno Plants and getting to a dead end. Everyone was perplexed as to where to go and we decided to pur the game down for a break as we had Christmas lunch to go to. I remember turning rhe game back on when we got home and I figured out to throw one of Yoshi's eggs or the question mark clouds and I was rreored as if I discovered rime travel! This memory is one that will always return me bocl<i to that moment and where my real interest in IT began from - the solving of problems. 
I chose to study or RMIT as it hos the reputation of being a premium tertiary educator, and with the way the World hos evolved and is still evolving in the digital space, I feel it not optional bur o necessity to be equipped With lmowledge and understandings and further education in these industries. I anticipate to complete my Two units of study (Introduction to IT and Introduction to Programming) to gain entry into o Dochelor of Information Technology. 
My expectation from studying these units is to form o foundation of lmowledge that is necessary to proceed Further in these areas of studying and really get a feel for an area that piques my interest. I enjoy worl<iing 
On my computer and find the ease of being remote practical and efficient that matches my worl<i ethic. I 
Also expect to learn o lot of what I don't know when ir comes ro information technology.
